# cpc-crappyfloppyadapter

This little board allows to use any "gotek" drive on a CPC.

There are two jumpers onboards:

Side - Allows to change the side of the disk you are loading.
Drive - Allows to altern between A (shorted) or B non connected jumper.

# bom

The components on this board are very simple. You will need a 2x13 2.54 female connector for the CPC side, a 2x17 male 2.54 connector. Also two 1x2 connectors are required for jumpers setting. That's all.
